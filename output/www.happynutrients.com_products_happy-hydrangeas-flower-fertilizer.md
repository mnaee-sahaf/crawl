Introducing Happy Hydrangeas, the premium flower fertilizer that's about to turn your garden into the envy of the neighborhood! Conceived and crafted with love in the US and and then developed with the expertise of agricultural wizards in Canada, this magical mix is your secret weapon to cultivating a vibrant oasis of floral brilliance right in your backyard.
With an ideal NPK ratio of 7-3-3, Happy Hydrangeas is not just any ordinary fertilizer; it's a powerful elixir designed specifically for your beloved azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias, gardenias, and magnolias. This 0.12 oz (or 0.34 kg) packet of joy is brimming with essential micronutrients and the added bonus of humic acid, ensuring your flowers receive the nourishment they need to thrive and bloom like never before.
Our mission is simple: to make you smile by transforming your garden space into a dazzling display of color and life. And with Happy Hydrangeas, achieving that goal has never been easier. Simply mix 1 scoop (equivalent to 1 tablespoon or 13 grams) per gallon of water, or for our metric friends, that's 4 grams per liter of water. Apply this magical concoction at planting or at the first signs of growth, and then every 14 days during the initial month. After that, a monthly application throughout the growing season will do the trick. Remember, the early bird gets the worm, or in this case, the early gardener gets the blooms! Apply during the cool of early morning or late evening to avoid the midday heat, and make sure it's the soil and roots that are getting all the love, not the leaves.
Happy Hydrangeas doesn't just feed your plants; it's packed with a nutrient-rich blend of nitrogen, phosphate, soluble potash, magnesium, sulfur, and a team of micronutrients including boron, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc. Each ingredient has been carefully selected to ensure your garden not only grows but glows with health and vitality.
So, whether you're looking to breathe new life into your garden, or you're on a mission to create a haven of tranquility and beauty, Happy Hydrangeas is here to help. Let's make your garden smile, one flower at a time!

Growing Tips 
Plant in well-draining, moist soil, and a location with morning sun and afternoon shade.
Water deeply a few times a week and use Happy Hydrangeas in Spring. Be mindful of the type of hydrangea for proper pruning, apply organic mulch to retain moisture, and protect them in winter if you're in a cold climate. 
Remember that hydrangeas may take time to establish and bloom profusely.
