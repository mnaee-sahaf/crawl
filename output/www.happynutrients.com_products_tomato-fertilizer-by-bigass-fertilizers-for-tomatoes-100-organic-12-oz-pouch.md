This makes applying this fertilizer much easier than other synthetic options on the market today because there aren't any unnecessary elements included in this product!

Growing Tips 
Apply fertilizer at the first sign of actively growing plants.
For optimal results, feed your plants every second watering but no more than once per week.
During very hot or very dry conditions, moisten the soil before fertilizing.
Use throughout the growth stage and fruiting stage on transplants as well as emerging seedlings and perennials. In short, use throughout the entire season. 
Choose varieties suited to your climate and plant them deep to encourage root growth. Ensure consistent watering and mulch around the base to retain moisture. Apply BigAss Tomatoes Fertilizer for optimal growth, prune for better airflow, and stake plants to provide support as they grow.

**Just okay**
I purchased and used throughout the summer. I didn’t grow Big A** tomatoes. I have Better Boy and Big Boy tomatoes. Neither got as big as I expected, even without the fertilizer. I was disappointed

**WOW!**
I used " Big Ass Tomatoes" fertilizer for the first time this past spring, and the end result is just "WOW"! Some of the tomatoes I planted were supposed to weigh at the most, 6-8 ounces! These are humongous! This is what happens when the RIGHT fertilizer is applied! I will continue to use all of the "Big Ass Fertilizers" in my garden! I am beyond happy with the results! I can't wait for next Spring, I'm already planning for more giants....I purchased a 3lb bag of "Big Ass Tomatoes Fertilizer"!
