## This Organic Fertilizer works well on the following plants:  

## Strawberry  

Strawberries are a beloved fruit known for their sweet, juicy flavor and bright red color. With proper care and maintenance, strawberry plants can produce fruit for several years.
At BigAss Fertlizers, we have developed an organic strawberry fertilizer specifically formulated to meet the unique needs of strawberry plants. Our product is packed with essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals to help your strawberry plants grow strong and produce delicious fruit. In addition, our fertilizer is made with 100% organic ingredients, so you can trust that your strawberries are free from toxic chemicals and harmful pesticides. Use our organic strawberry fertilizer to give your plants the nourishment they need to thrive and produce sweet, juicy strawberries for years to come.
## Blueberry
One of the easiest crops for amateur gardeners is blueberries, which require little space, have few pests, and produce berries for many years.
At **BigAss** , we've got a fertilizer perfect for any of your blueberry plants, as it contains all the nutrients they need to be healthier and juicier. However, it doesn't contain any harsh chemicals or artificial ingredients.   

## Raspberry
Raspberries are one of the most well-known and recognized fruits, and with proper maintenance, raspberry plants can grow and bear fruit for many years.
At **Big Ass** , we've worked hard to create an organic raspberry fertilizer that will fulfill all the needs of **raspberry plants** to help them grow to their full potential, so you'll finally enjoy their sweet taste without having to worry about toxic chemicals or harmful pesticides.
## Blackberry
Blackberry plants don't need to be taken care of for you to reap a bountiful harvest, but if you want to produce a bountiful crop, fertilization is one aspect to which you must pay attention.
At Big Ass, our fertilizer formula is specifically designed to target the nutritional needs of **blackberry plants** by blending premium-quality ingredients with all the necessary nutrients to produce berries that are big enough for even the fussiest eater to enjoy.

Growing Tips 
Strawberry Tips - plant in a sunny area. Give plants some space usually 18 inches apart. Water wisely. Lookout for snails and slugs.
Blueberry Tips - select a sunny sheltered spot. Avoid harsh drying winds. Don't plant blueberries too close to trees.
Raspberry Tips - Early spring is the best time to plant. Keep plants damp in summer, dry in winter. Plants like rich, well drained soil. Water regularly especially during summer. 
Blackberry tips. Don't stress if your first few harvests aren't amazing as it can take 2-3 seasons for plants to producing plump and juicy fruit. Plant in early spring, right after the last frost. Plant in soil with good drainage.

**Works suprisingly well !**
This worked very well for our haskap berries this year. We harvested about twice the number of berries as last year, and they're noticeably larger and more plump. We'll definitely use it again next year.

**Made by berries big and juicy**
Wasn’t sure this would work, but I gave it a go and my berries are actually producing much better. More berries, and larger too. Only thing is it stinks a bit when you water afterward, but any natural fertilizer does, so it’s not really a negative. I’ll definitely be using this product in the future.
