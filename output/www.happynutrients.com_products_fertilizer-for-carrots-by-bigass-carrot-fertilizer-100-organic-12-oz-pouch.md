**Carrot Fertilizer Tips**  

  * Allows your plant's roots to spread out freely so they can take in all the nutrients they need without worrying about exposure to harmful chemicals or other dangers.


  * Provide macro- and micronutrients to your plant's roots, where they are most needed, saving time and money by not having to be absorbed through leaves first!


  * Increase the yield of your root crops by feeding them a complete set of natural nutrients, which will help the plants grow and produce more vegetables, or tubers.


  * Give your food a rich taste and improve its quality as they are made from natural ingredients such as rock phosphate and kelp meal.


**Big Carrots Fertilizer Works On the Following:**
  * **Carrots**


Like other root crops, carrots benefit from fertilizers that are high in phosphorus and potassium and low in nitrogen. And guess what? BigAss has precisely that. The secret to our formula is that it contains NPK and other trace nutrients in just the correct percentage to give your carrots everything they need—and nothing they don't so you can get juicer, redder carrots.
  * **Onions**


As heavy feeders, onions require many nutrients in your plant food. That's why Big Ass created our organic fertilizer for onions because we wanted to ensure that anyone who wants to grow them has all the nutrients they need. Our fertilizer is natural and nutritious, so you don't have to worry about harmful chemicals entering your soil or plants.  

  * **Ginger**


One of the biggest mistakes new ginger gardeners make is failing to feed their plants at precisely the right time. Big Ass organic fertilizer for ginger is the ideal tailored combination of macro- and micronutrients that promotes vital plant health and outstanding rhizome development. Just mix it with the soil and let it do its magic. 
  * **Garlic**


Garlic is a long-season crop that takes several days to reach maturity, so it needs proper fertilization. And Big Ass is here to help with fertilization by providing high-quality fertilizer to grow big and beautiful garlic. The secret? Our blend of ingredients provides nutrients that benefit the growth of garlic roots and bulbs. Plus, this fertilizer is free of chemicals or additives—you can feel good about using it on your veggies!  

  * **Radish**


Radishes may be the kings of the high-yield plants since they mature quickly. However, they grow more effectively with a radish plant fertilizer. That's where our organic fertilizer comes in, as it contains everything your radishes require; it's packed with nutrients that will help your radishes grow big and juicy so you can enjoy their delicious flavor all summer!
Our carrot fertilizer is made using organic fertilizers and can help improve soil content as they add nutrients and promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. The vegetable fertilizer has a highly-soluble powder formula that ensures fast absorption to the root and quick nutrient delivery.
If you take the time to grow your own carrots, you might as well do it right. Grow with Big Ass Carrot Fertilizer and get the best possible results.

Growing Tips 
Carrots do not like to be transplanted.
Always sow seeds where you plan to grow the carrots.
Plant seeds about 1/2 inch deep and 1 inch apart.
Row spacing should be 12 inches apart.
Cover seeds with 1/3 inch layer of potting soil.
To know best dates to plant your carrot seeds, checkonline to view your optimal "frost-free" growing dates in your zip code.
Carrots can handle a little frost but typically they should be harvested by then.
Carrots are a cool weather crop so they grow well anytime except the summertime. Carrots will grow in full sun or part shade. The more sunlight you give them, the faster your harvest will grow. Soil should be light, fluffy so you don't create any obstacles for the main tap root. Carrots are slow to germinate. 
Water regularly and keep soil moist so carrots continue to grow deeper in the soil
Keeping the soil moist around the carrots will also help yield juicy, crunch, and sweet carrots. Keep weeds away.
